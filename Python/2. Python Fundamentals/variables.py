#Python Numeric Literals
# 1. Integer Literals
# Integer literals are numbers without decimal parts. It also consists of negative numbers. For example, 5, -11, 0, 12, etc.
integer = 22

# 2. Floating-Point Literals
# Floating-point literals are numbers that contain decimal parts.
# Just like integers, floating-point numbers can also be both positive and negative. For example, 2.5, 6.76, 0.0, -9.45, etc.
float = 22.2

# 3. Complex Literals
# Complex literals are numbers that represent complex numbers.

# Here, numerals are in the form a + bj, where a is real and b is imaginary. For example, 6+9j, 2+3j.

#Python String Literals

# Python Boolean Literals

# Character Literals in Python

print(char)

# Collection Literals

#Lists
fruits = ['Apple',200,'Orange',300]
print(fruits)

#tuple
veg = ('Potato','Onion',200)
print(veg)

#Dict
my_dict = {
   'Firstname' : 'Umer',

#Sets (Unorderd)
myset = {
    'a','i'
